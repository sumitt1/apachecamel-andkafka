##  SpringBatch-KafkaDB Demo ##
---

### What is it? ###
A small demo that leverages Spring batch's capabilities to do job processing and Apache Kafka's stream processing.
A simple CSV file is used in a batch job which then writes it to a Kafka Producer for further processing.
A Kafka consumer can then verify by consuming the messages from the correct topic.

### Spring Batch pipeline ###
Below mentioned pipeline has been followed through out the codebase. The implementation is trivial once you modularize the responsibilities of each relevant class.

### Prerequisites ###
* Spring Boot + Batch + JPA  
* Apache Kafka
* Apache Zookeeper

---

### Expectation ###
 Batch systems offer tremendous advantages as compared to interactive systems.
 * Repeated jobs are done fast in batch systems without user interaction.
 * You donâ€™t need special hardware and system support to input data in batch systems.
 * Best for large organizations but small organizations can also benefit from it.
 ---
 Expectation is to convert the following flat file into something meaningful when run as a batch process.

 * Such as a Kafka stream like this *

 * Or to a datastore like this *

### Setting up Apache Kafka ###
```
  # Start Zookeeper instance 
  $ zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties
  
  # Start Kafka server
  $ kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties
  
  # Create a topic
  $ kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic CSV_TOPIC_K
  
```
 Make sure following is appended to **config\server.properties**
 ```
 port = 9092
 advertised.host.name = localhost 
 ```

### What are the list of branches ###
Branch | Description
------------ | -------------
master | Base branch that reads from CSV and processes them to a topic in a Kafka producer
batch-db-upload | Similar to master except that it deserializes the CSV to a H2 Database instead of Kafka
